# monitoring incoming NDP traffic. monitor provides limited functionality in
# comparison to advertise and is mostly useful for verifying the status and

# true on the same interface.

  # delegates a /48 prefix on a WAN interface. The router will configure a /48
  # unreachable route on loopback (as it owns the entire delegated prefix), but
